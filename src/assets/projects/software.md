## Software Developer

Positive professional with a passion for software applications and cultivating relationships.  Currently seeking a Software/Solutions Engineer position that will allow me to transform, build, develop and ship customized software solutions to various clients and business partners. 

> Although my professional path has taken many twists and turns — from small business owner, developer and entrepreneur, to high-end caterer and dean's list student, to senior sales consultant and starting grad school — I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me and I have never stopped engaging my passion to help others and ultimately solve problems with technology. 

**I’m very excited for what’s next! [Let's Work Together](./#contact)**

Currently as a developer, I enjoy using my attention to detail and my customer-driven work ethic to work on turning ideas into reality while mentoring students, and educating new businesses on building up their web presence, ecommerce, social media and technical needs. 

However, I’m ready to move up and start solving real-world business challenges and make a bigger impact through a high growth company platform and community.
