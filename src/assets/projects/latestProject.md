## Coding Interview Preparation App

It is a companion App for solving and keeping track of all the questions and challenges you have solved while preparing for coding interviews.
 The idea came out of necessity trying to keep track of all the questions that I have solved in multiple platforms and trying to stay on top
  of my latest learned skills in app development during the pandemic period. 

> *The app simply allows me to enter a question including question description and examples. Thereafter, I can enter multiple solutions to the
>question including code, my algo description and notes. I can review, test and see all the questions that I have solved sorted by category
>and solution type and displayed them in one convenient responsive place.* 

Ultimately, I can review questions, launch and test the code stored in my solutions and access it all online without my local environment
 using the app account, question editor with markdown, own questions api and CodeSandbox support for testing your code. The app is continuously being developed on my own
  time using the mern stack to develop multiple components and working prototypes. 

**Currently you can see the Questions Display Component of the app in the [Fragment Below](./#App)**
